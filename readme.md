This was my Electronics Engineering Bachelor Thesis Project (2015).

Nikos Lazaridis, Technical University of Piraeus, Greece.

CC3200 acting as the telemetry intermediate between Ground Control Station (GCS) and APM Ardupilot flight controller on Quadcopter Drone.

In Greek only currently. You can find it in ``Thesis_QuadcopterTelemetry_Nikos_Lazaridis_ppapag.pdf`.

Most of the code has been written in Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio 6. I haven't tested it with updated CCS versions.
